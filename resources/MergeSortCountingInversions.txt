In an array, arr, the elements at indices i and j (where i < j) form an inversion if arr[i] > arr[j]. In other words, inverted elements arr[i] and arr[j] are considered to be "out of order". To correct an inversion, we can swap adjacent elements.

For example, consider the dataset arr = [2, 4, 1]. It has two inversions: (4, 1) and (2, 1). To sort the array, we must perform the following two swaps to correct the inversions:
arr = [2, 4, 1] -> swap(arr[1], arr[2]) -> swap(arr[0], arr[1]) -> [1, 2, 4]

Print the number of inversions that must be swapped to sort each dataset on a new line.
