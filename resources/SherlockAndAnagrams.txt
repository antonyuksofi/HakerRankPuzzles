Having an input string, find the amount of pairs of unordered anagrams within it.

Unordered anagrams are strings, that have the same characters of the same amount.

For example: abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba.

The amount of pairs is:
n! / ((n - 2)! * 2!) = n * (n - 1) / 2.

For the anagrams above it is 6 * 5 / 2 = 15.
